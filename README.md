This project is following a Udemy course titled "Build a Blockchain and Cryptocurrency from Scratch".

This project uses Node.JS, so if you're keen to try it out, you'll need to:

* ensure you are running the lastest version of node
* clone the repository
* run `npm i[nstall]` to install the required dependencies
* `npm run test` should run the test suite (which uses `jest`)
* `npm run dev` will run the development server

I have not run a build on it for release, as I haven't planned much for it past this state.
